"1","Patch Set 2: Code-Review-2 review master 1st","A"
"2","Patch Set 4: I don't really like this (opinion; let's get others). iotivity has just one license. for the external projects, it should be enough just to list them (maybe with a http link), and it should not be a variable list. so I'm thinking just make the LEGAL.md and commit it.","A"
"3","Patch Set 4: This change is not critical, but since it was accepted in tizen spec file, I thought it could be done at scons level, to make it usable for all. Note iotivity binaries are shiping builds extlibs, so I wanted to make sure everything was compatible and not omited. I am also considering to commit LEGAL.md and keep this scanner to track changes if any.","A"
"4","Patch Set 5: (1 comment) plugins/samples/linux/IotivityandZigbeeClient.c Line 39: at the current state I would say that all example are experimental unless specified. This change is making this example buildable using installed (experimentals) headers. So either logger and client of logger are experimental and this change should goes in :) either logger (plus payload logger) is not experimental and belongs to API, then it should be installed along other headers.","A"
"5","Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1 (1 comment) -1 pending answer to my question plugins/samples/linux/IotivityandZigbeeClient.c Line 37: samples should only include experimental headers if the sample itself is declared as experimental. (see https://wiki.iotivity.org/api_guidelines) Is this sample documented as experimental somewhere or somehow? Where? Remember ""All public APIs must be used in some sample code or snippet"" and ""Experimental APIs should ideally be used in some sample code (separate from samples that use only public APIs) or snippet. Ideally, the sample should be one that is compiled as part of the build. For rarely used APIs, the sample might simply be a snippet in the doxygen comments.""","A"
"6","Patch Set 3: Since 1.3.1 is all-but-final (I think a few WES issues remain only) can we cherry pick to master and abandon the 1.3-rel version? This looks like a very large change to push into 1.3-rel at this point.","A"
"7","Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1 (8 comments) In general experimental APIs should not be used in the same samples meant to be the samples for public APIs. As such, either the logging APIs need to be public, or we need new samples that do not use experimental APIs. resource/csdk/security/provisioning/sample/cloud/cloudAuth.c Line 22: Since this sample uses experimental APIs, please include a notice in README-cloud.txt that there is no guarantee of support for this sample code in future releases, nor is there any guarantee that breaking changes will not occur across releases. resource/csdk/resource-directory/samples/rd_queryClient.cpp Line 24: Since this sample uses experimental APIs, please include a notice somewhere that there is no guarantee of support for this sample code in future releases, nor is there any guarantee that breaking changes will not occur across releases. resource/csdk/security/provisioning/sample/autoprovisioningclient.c Line 38: Since this sample uses experimental APIs, please include a notice in README-Provisioning-Tool.txt that there is no guarantee of support for this sample code in future releases, nor is there any guarantee that breaking changes will not occur across releases. resource/csdk/security/tool/svrdbeditor_src/svrdbeditorcred.c Line 38: Since this tool uses experimental APIs, please include a notice somewhere that there is no guarantee of support for this sample code in future releases, nor is there any guarantee that breaking changes will not occur across releases. resource/csdk/stack/samples/linux/OCSample/ocserver.c Line 36: Since this sample code uses experimental APIs, please include a notice somewhere that there is no guarantee of support for this sample code in future releases, nor is there any guarantee that breaking changes will not occur across releases. resource/csdk/resource-directory/samples/rd_publishingClient.cpp Line 29: Since this sample uses experimental APIs, please include a notice somewhere that there is no guarantee of support for this sample code in future releases, nor is there any guarantee that breaking changes will not occur across releases. resource/csdk/stack/samples/linux/OCSample/occlient.c Line 34: Since this sample code uses experimental APIs, please include a notice somewhere that there is no guarantee of support for this sample code in future releases, nor is there any guarantee that breaking changes will not occur across releases. resource/csdk/stack/samples/arduino/SimpleClientServer/ocserver/ocserver.cpp Line 24: Since this sample code uses experimental APIs, please include a notice somewhere that there is no guarantee of support for this sample code in future releases, nor is there any guarantee that breaking changes will not occur across releases.","A"

"9","Patch Set 5: Verified+1 @Dave, I prefer to not change this patch but I prepared this one for you: https://gerrit.iotivity.org/gerrit/#/c/23483/","A"
"10","Patch Set 3: Change makes since to me. I will give this a +1 this seems like an issue caused by not having clear list of public header files. I am not completely convinced the logging should be made public. Since we already have samples and code that assume it is public this change makes since.","A"

"12","Patch Set 2: (1 comment) Dockerfile Line 70: I would suggest to provide a ARG to allow customization of the scons build, e.g. ARG buildargs and then call scons with scons VERBOSE=1 ${buildargs}","A"
"13","Patch Set 6: Like I did for tizen: https://gerrit.iotivity.org/gerrit/#/c/23451/ or fedora OK to relocate, I still think it could be good to have a default docker file, maybe I will propose one that clone from sources. Anyway there is no emergency to merge this.","A"
"14","Patch Set 2: Partly answering myself, it seems the prep.sh call is relative to the top of the iotivity tree.","A"
"15","Patch Set 6: As Martin says, we should wrap this in a script which allows for some customization. That would also allow more easily running from a non-top-level directory, there's enough stuff in the top already. There is already a tools/docker directory so as mentioned I'd prefer it there.","A"
"16","Patch Set 2: One benefit or putting them in root folder, use could run docker build $URL","A"
"17","Patch Set 2: can we put this in the same place as the vagrantfile (that is, a subdir under tools)? I'm not sure that is the perfect place either but it would be nice to keep things consistent.","A"
"18","Patch Set 3: I got kind of interested in the idea too. The vagrant setup does clone the repo inside the new machine, which is straightforward, but also if you look from a distance, you already checked out the tree to get the vagrant script, it's tempting to be able to reuse that checkout the way the docker set up does instead of cloning again. So I don't know which is ""right"" :(","A"

"24","Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1 Just shared does not worth to be committed there is enough confusion with our build scripts","A"
"25","Patch Set 1: Note there are two separate issues here: at the moment the Jar sort-of-builder wants a flat list, passing a list of objects from the Java builder and adding the manifest to that in a list would give a two-element list the first element of which is itself a list. It looks like this is going to change in scons. A more explicit way to do this would have been to rewrite this: source=simpleclient_classes + [File('MANIFEST.MF')]) as source=Flatten([simpleclient_classes, File('MANIFEST.MF'])_ The second item is that if the manifest is passed as a file and variant dir is in effect, the new scons code checking for non-objects (that is strings) will not find the manifest and will omit it, which means you get the default instead.","A"

"32","Patch Set 1: The need for multiple device support or virtual devices keeps on coming up when working on bridging code. The need to specify that the bridge and the discovered devices. For that reason I have once again revisited the code. I decided to try and fix the build errors. Most of the build errors were minor and easy to find. When running the unit tests the code hits the assert in the CAGetDefaultDevice. this happens when calling CAInitialize(CA_DEFAULT_ADAPTER) some where along the line the caglobals.headLocalDevice is not being set.","A"
"33","Patch Set 11: (1 comment) build_common/SConscript Line 899: 1. the current python convention is a stanza like def ScanJson(env, directory=None): if not directory: directory = '.' that doesn't mean it's wrong as written. 2. Python won't let you assign inside an if statement (it's a syntax errror) so there's no need for the backwards comparison this project insists on using for C code.","A"

"40","Patch Set 3: Windows is typically the target that has more difficulty. You must add a *.def file to export functions to a dll or you have to add dll export to the code. For C code like coap-http-proxy this is not generally a hard thing to do, make a *.def file. For C++ it is harder because of the function decorations added by the compiler means you can not add a *.def file and must add dllexport to the code. For that reason none of the C++ code is compiled to a dll yet. This has actually caused some major problems getting the java language bindings to work for windows. We have to have a shared library for all the platforms or statically link for all the platforms. At least when doing Java via JNI.","A"

Nathan, Currently, these applications are not certifiable and they fail CTT. However, they do not affect the regression testing as they are isolated in their own folder and do not change the source code at all in any way. They simply use the source code. I will eventually tackle those CTT failures in the near future as I intend to provide these applications as a baseline for those seeking to certify their applications.

@Jong-Min I agree it would be good to have this patch in 1.3.1 because of the multiple CA issue.  However I am not comfortable that I understand the parsing implications well enough... Kevin's -1 hasn't been removed yet (but I think Oleksii addressed his PEM/DER conversion comments).  I'm on vacation right now so I don't have time to look into the changes deeply.

@Kevin if you are okay with the change now that Oleksii has updated, and are ok removing your -1, let us know and I'll merge.

Otherwise, maybe Randeep (maintainer) can take the time to look over this change carefully and merge if suitable.","B"

This patch is needed to make it easier to run mfg OTM test. Without this patch you cannot have two different root CA certificates in SVR DB and expect both will be used in certificate verification. This means that when you run mfg OTM test, you need to be careful in how you create your SVR DB.
For this reason, given that system TCs and CTT TCs pass with this patch, I think it's much better to merge this patch.","B"

A lot of this code appears to be the PEM/DER work from 22983. At the time I recall we decided this work should go into master, not 1.3-rel. What is the justification for bringing this work in now?

If this work will come in with this change, then as I note in the commit message, it needs to reflect this as well. The now-reverted change that introduced this code did not mention at all the PEM/DER conversion changes that were also in that work.

I'm suspicious of this reasoning, especially since this is improvement work targeted at master. If the sheer volume of work to handle errors in some sensible way is so large it's not worth doing, that may be an acceptable argument, but correcting IoTivity's repeated failure to properly check and handle error conditions properly should be a long-term improvement goal in this codebase.
resource/csdk/security/provisioning/src/oxmpreconfpin.c
Line 110: I again seek a compelling reason not to check != 0 to protect against future changes in mbedTLS that might result in other error codes being returned.

resource/csdk/security/provisioning/src/multipleownershiptransfermanager.c
Line 884: Telling me the function you're replacing/improvement did something unwise does not justify doing something unwise. You're seeking to improve this code, so let's improve it. This code is going to master so we should take the time to do things properly. IoTivity's habitual ignoring of error return values is not a model to be emulated.

The API documentation does say it will return zero or this error, but is there a compelling reason not to have your implementation simply compare != 0 in case this ever changes in the future? What benefit is there to checking only this one error code when checking against zero would seem to accomplish the same plus make the code more robust against future API contract changes?

@George: the ""regression test"" (offically run by GRL) hasn't been defined yet but that's something I really want to get going before EOY.  In the meantime, it'd be a good idea for high-touch patches to run the CTT 1.5.30 (or later) against the HEAD + branch before merging.  If you haven't done that yet it's pretty easy once you've got it set up but that can be a hassle.  Contact me via email if you haven't run CTT before, and want to try it out... I can probably save you time, at least with the security tests (which is actually all I run, myself, counting on GRL/Antu to run the rest).","A"

Any chance this was regression tested using CTT?","C"
"413","Patch Set 8:

Happy to do that!  There's no wiki as far as I know, though there maybe should be.  The short version is that I run the sampleserver_justworks app as the Server (a.k.a. Implementation Under Test ""IUT"") and then run the CTT against it.  However there are some config steps that need documenting.

Since this is against master, it's not as critical to run the regression prior to merging (other patches aren't).  I'll spend a few mins writing up a wiki and running a test against this patch (merged) when I'm back in the office next week.","B"

Line 99: Seems like discussion some months ago was suggesting to move away from shared libs. So some justification might be useful here.
","A"
"418","Patch Set 3:

Windows is typically the target that has more difficulty.  You must add a *.def file to export functions to a dll or you have to add dll export to the code.

For C code like coap-http-proxy this is not generally a hard thing to do, make a *.def file. For C++ it is harder because of the function decorations added by the compiler means you can not add a *.def file and must add dllexport to the code. For that reason none of the C++ code is compiled to a dll yet.  This has actually caused some major problems getting the java language bindings to work for windows.

We have to have a shared library for all the platforms or statically link for all the platforms. At least when doing Java via JNI.","A"

Line 338: Yes.. this code enables non-secure resource in secure build. I am not sure exact use case as this code has been here from long time and I don't know all the history, but it may be for development and debugging purpose. Easy Setup API provides an option for application to decide whether or not it wants to create a secure or non-secure resource irrespective of build option. If the resource is created non secure, it will be possible to do a GET / POST on it without doing ownership transfer i guess (assuming correct ACLs are in place) (?)

Even though I agree with George that it's very low risk, we are within a day or two of final tagging for 1.3.1 and this isn't fixing a cert-blocker, so I'd rather wait for after RC5 tagging to merge, just as a matter of sticking to that criteria.

Seems okay to make these changes since I think most Devices will indeed want to grant access to the introspection Resources once onboarding is finished.

Line 2478: It would be preferable to do this is two separate Update requests.  The Specification says that the /pstat.rowneruuid should be set, before changing /pstat.dos.s = RF_PRO.  This call happens to work because IoTivity applies the rowneruuid change before attempting to update dos.s, but that might not be the case with another stack.  

Not a critical fix in this case, but it would be best to first Update rowneruuid, then update dos.s.

And regarding restoring prevId, if the PS update fails and we are here, we should not restore the previous ID, we should still leave it in gAcl but post an ERROR log message saying that the PS update failed.  In fact I can't think of any case in which we want to restore prevId, except if the memcpy new->gAcl fails, which we aren't checking.

I think we should create %{buildroot}%{_includedir}/experimental/ for this kind of header files that need future improvements. It should be clear that we'll most likely need to make breaking changes to this header file, in the future. 

Example of improvements needed here:
- Should securevirtualresourcetypes.h and everything inside it be Public?
- Public APIs should have consistent names, but ConfigSelfOwnership is not consistent with the other names from the same file
- Etc.","A"

Assuming this was meant to fix smoke test, I ran provisioninclient + sampleserver_justworks after applying this patch, here's what I saw

So looks like smoke test still broken?

Interestingly, I did a  follow-on ""10"" after this, and even with the above error, looks like provisioning client thinks OTM was successful?

This may well pass on retry, but looks like a real error - reference through an uninit field apparently (presumably it's normally okay since 1.3 builds normally work).

Dave I am still working though the commit.  Here are my initial questions. I am sure I will have much more as I keep working though the change.

from the looks of it I still have 2/3 of the code left to review.
resource/csdk/connectivity/inc/cainterfacecontroller.h
Line 186: documentation cleanup that could be moved to master.

resource/csdk/connectivity/inc/caipadapter.h
Line 141: documentation cleanup that could be moved to master.

resource/csdk/connectivity/api/cacommon.h
Line 616: is this really device independent?  Wouldn't the ipv4/ipv6 be a attribute of the platform not the device?
Line 662: you tell me what ocState is not but I have no clue what it actually is.

It this everything to do with the device that is not connection related?
Line 789: could add code sample here

Example:

  CALocalDevice_t *myDevice = CACreateLocalDevice(false, true);
  CASetPortNumberTosAssign(myDevice, my_transport_adapter, my_flags, 75657);
  CAStartLocalDevice(myDevice)

This is not needed but it could improve the quality of the documentation for future developers.

Doxygen supports markdown style syntax and so for a minimum you could use `CAStartLocalDevice` and `CASetPortNumberToAssign()` to make it display fixed width font (that is the back tick ""`"" character).
Line 808: If is local device has muliple local references and this is called will is still be deleted or will the ref count be decremented?

If it is deleted then we will need a function to check the ref count to decided if this should really be deleted.
Line 828: need 
  @return
    - returns true if device is OC_SERVER
    - returns false if device is OC_CLIENT
    - returns true if device is OC_CLIENT_SERVER
    - returns true if device is OC_GATEWAY

I am just giving examples I am not sure that about the actual return values.

resource/csdk/connectivity/inc/camessagehandler.h
Line 113: Just wondering do you know of a way to test single threaded code on a multi threaded machine?

resource/csdk/connectivity/src/cainterfacecontroller.c
Line 426: should this assert be an if statement instead of an assert?
Line 441: how hard would this be to move out?

I assume it would not actually be that hard but you just don't want to do it for this first commit.
Line 503: would this make more since if it were

  if (result == 0)

I know that in C int can be treated like a boolean but the refCount is a number not a boolean.

resource/csdk/connectivity/api/cainterface.h
Line 152: This is an API breaking change. Not sure how to handle this. In C++ it could be easy to just use function overloading and use the default device.

Should we add a CACreateEndpointX(...) where X is the updated API while adjusting the code for CACreateEndpoint to use the default device so it continues to work as before?

  CAResult_t CACreateEndpoint(CATransportFlags_t, ...)
  CAResult_t CACreateEndpointa(CALocalDevice_t*, CATransportFlags_t, ...) 


This is the only place I am going to ask this question but it shows up in many other locations.

Two objections. First, I don't think ""experimental"" belongs in the source three for various reasons (e.g. it's metadata, for one).  But if we must have it, the way to deal with it is to adjust the build scripts (e.g. add ""-Iexperimental"") rather than injecting ""experimental/"" into source code #defines. That way you can easily relocate it later and you only have to edit the build scripts.","B"

@Kevin and Dan: this fix is here because we patched the /cred Resource to correclty have a single global rowneruuid, but now the cases where we're marshaling something other than IoTivity's current /cred (e.g. using the marshaling code in json2cbor) break unless we allow them to supply their own rowneruuid (optionally).  I think this fixes it; can you guys take a look?  12th hour changes like this I don't want to merge without additional reviewers.

Line 75: Comment should instruct callers to call OICFree on cborPayload when finished with it. Right now OICFree and free are the same thing so this will still work, but these functions use the OICCalloc functions internally and so we should match with the correct functions.

Also, extraneous space at the end of this line.

This CAN go in. It doesn't break anything except for a corner case in line 113. It may even be considered to add consistency.

The plugins in the bridging directory should however use C++ std::string() and use == to compare a smuch as possible.
resource/c_common/oic_string/src/oic_string.c
Line 111: Why would one use this function instead of just strcmp or strncmp?
I posit there is no safety to be had here unless there is a safe version of strlen. This just shifts the failure point in case of non null terminated strings to the callee as **someone** has to call strlen and then pass it in here.

Besides, if there are non null terminated strings floating around the system, it is already late.

A reasonable version of a safe equals imo, would accept two strings and an uint and only compare some number of characters for equality which is exactly what strncmp does. Besides strcmp and strncmp compare only as many characters as the smaller string.
Line 113: Two strings of length 0 are equal. Although it is unlikely this function will be called with such strings, it is still incorrect.

This seems like a relatively-complex change. I can live with it if needed, but I would prefer one of these other changes, in the order of my preference:

OR

2. Add iotivity_config.h into .gitignore, as a trivial alternative to this more complex patch.

It's an improvement (not to call gtest sconscript from everywhere!). Still exploring some maybe better ways than doing Clone() everywhere (it is a very expensive function to SCons) and the maintainers tell me that's not really necessary as you can supply target-specific args to a builder.  Still, this may be a decent way to ease into a bigger change of that sort.","B"

For that matter though, this isn't the right place to be closing off the anon cipher suite... that should be done as soon as a message is received over the anon DTLS session.  I'm going to try an update that fixes it.

Separately, the CTT should *not* be trying to initiate OTM mid-way through onboarding.  I don't know what that's about but I've emailed Mitch to ask him to fix the CTT.

resource/csdk/connectivity/common/src/parsechain.c
Line 64: Certificates are considered public data, and so there's no security reason to zero their contents before freeing. I suggest removing this line.

In general, though, don't use memset for this purpose. The compiler may see tmp1->cert->data isn't used again before being freed and optimize the memset call out. Always use OICClearMemory to zero contents of sensitive buffers, as this function is designed to make sure it doesn't get optimized out by the compiler.

Awesome. That means someone else broke our code and we didn't know about it. Well, hopefully it will get sorted out by the CTT testing. But since that's not your fault this change can go ahead.","B"

This is further made strange by the calling code specifically checking for PSTAT in the case of AMS and CMS, making this seem a bit redundant.

Can you clarify this design? Does it make more sense either not to check the resource type in these functions (thus making their function more accurately described by their names) or should all the checking of resource type be done here and not by the caller (in which case a renaming may be in order for clarity)?

Please see my (long) note on doxmresource.c ""HandleDoxmPostRequestSetRownerId()"" function.  That said, we can still merge this patch (which fixes many other things; thanks!) when Kevin gives a +1, but I want people working on this code to understand that the Server should never be changing the ""rowneruuid"" for any SVR (/acl, /cred, /doxm or /pstat) unless a POST for that SVR containing ""rowneruuid"" is received.  The exception is /pstat.dos RESET, which clears those values and sets them to the Nil UUID.  Any other place where these values are being changed (outside of the POST handler for that SVR in question) is wrong and must be removed or the CTT will continue to fail.  I've captured the ""TODO"" in JIRA IOT-2805 and IOT-2816; See my inline comment for more details.  Thanks!
resource/csdk/security/src/doxmresource.c
Line 1245: This function (HandleDoxmPostRequestSetROwnerId()) still needs to be removed... it's wrong to set all the rowneruuids for the /cred, /pstat and /acl SVR here in the Server ""automagically"", and the CTT is failing on this step (see [IOT-2805] which I'm working on).

These SVR.rowneruuids must be Updated on a per-SVR basis by the provisioningclient, prior to moving the device to RFPRO.

Once this function (...SetRownerId()) is removed, the provisioningclient will need to be fixed also, to POST the rowneruuid Update to each of these four SVRs.

I've provided an example patch for this doxm.rowneruuid (see https://gerrit.iotivity.org/gerrit/#/c/22829/). This shows where and how the provisioningclient should POST the new rowneruuid for each SVR in question, using /doxm as a template.

The same template can be applied to the /pstat Resource, which also has a ""partial payload"" binary->CBOR marshaling function (which allows creation of a payload containing just the rowneruuid Property).  However the /acl and /cred functions do not have this ""partial payload"" function written yet.  So either a) these functions must be written for /acl and /cred (using /doxm or /pstat as example) or b) the provisioningclient must do a GET on the /acl2 Resource, change the ""rowneruuid"", and POST the changed (full) representation.

I've created a JIRA ticket to fix the provisioningclient; see [IOT-2815].

Thanks for the work... I have some questions; let's get them sorted out before merge please.
resource/csdk/security/src/pstatresource.c
Line 880: similar to /acl, we do want to update rowner if the Update payload contained an ""rowner"" Property.

resource/csdk/security/src/credresource.c
Line 1733: this removal looks correct to me

resource/csdk/security/src/aclresource.c
Line 2938: Okay I looked more closely at this code just now, and I don't think removing this outright is correct... the /acl.rownerID should be updated, if (and only if) the rownerID was included in the Update payload sent from the Client.

I believe the intent of this code was that it would *always* copy the newAcl->rownerID into gAcl->rownerID, because the CBOR->ACL marshaling function is meant to either a) copy a the rownerID from the CBOR payload, or b) copy the existing gAcl->rownerID into the newAcl, before returning.  Therefore the idea (I think) was that when we get to this line 2938, the newAcl->rownerID is either a valid new rowner from the CBOR payload, or a copy of the existing rowner, so either way, it's okay to copy it.

HOWEVER, if you look at the CBOR to ACL marshaling function, you'll see that the behavior is broken there (line 2049).  The existing gAcl rowner only gets copied into newAcl in some cases, not all, I believe.

I think the correct behavior would be that the CBOR->ACL marshaling code only modifies gAcl->rownerID if the ""rowner"" tag is found, otherwise it leaves it unchanges (so, removing the else if clause on line 2049).  And then, this line (the Update request handler) modifies gAcl ONLY if the newAcl->rownerID is not NULL (which would imply that rowner was in the CBOR payload and thus is being Updated).

What do you think?
Line 3070: This line also would need to be updated to behave in the same way as the above!

Kevin, if you have time, we could really use help looking over the logic in this fix.

If dst->mom is NULL to start with, attempt to allocate memory for it.

The _DEFAULT_SOURCE macro is part of the glibc

I assume that the use of _DEFAULT_SOURCE was a typo and the actual macro should be _GNU_SOURCE which handle very different things.

Line 189: Hi Uze, latest of this patch is Patch#7 and you seem to have reviewed Patch#6. 

Also, about media type checking, core spec text has a mandatory requirement specifically when describing links property. 

<Section 7.6.3.3.1 From Core Spec> 
---
The Representation determined by this Interface depends on the requesting Client. For a Client that includes an OCF-Accept-Content-Format-Version option as defined in section 12.2.5 in the request the response only includes the Property Value of the “links” Property, hence a Collection or /oic/res response with oic.if.ll is an array of OCF Links. For a Client that does not include an OCF-Accept-Content-Format-Version option the response is as defined in E.5.
----

Hence the version checking should be on OCF-Accept-Content-Format-Version as per spec requirement.

Looks good, thanks!

A clarifying question:

I think I recall that %zu is specifically provided for size_t vars... have you checked that all these %zu -> %u replacements are actually printing u32s or u16s (as opposed to size_ts) so that we don't get warnings on 64-bit vs 32-bit systems?

Visual Studio 2015's compiler actually does support %zu, and MSDN is just wrong that it doesn't. I filed a doc bug but who knows if it'll ever get fixed.

2013 and before, though, it's correct that it was unsupported and PRIuPTR was the way to go for a portable printf format specifier.","A"

Line 2100: Extraneous blank line you've added here; please remove.

resource/csdk/connectivity/api/casecurityinterface.h
Line 134: Ok, this still isn't quite right.

In your current implementation, assuming the CN is found, IoTivity allocates a buffer, passes that buffer with the contents included, but does not free that buffer. The implication is that the caller is responsible for taking ownership of this memory and freeing it later.

I think this is a bad design, actually. I think you should change ""cn"" to be ""const unsigned char *"" and make it clear that the buffer is only valid while the callback is running; the callback is responsible for copying the contents out elsewhere if it wants to retain this data after the callback finishes executing. IoTivity should then free it when the callback returns. (Or you could just pass in the subject field directly, if you make it const.)

If you still think IoTivity should allocate memory and give it to the callback to take ownership of, alright, but then your documentation needs to be very explicit that ""cn"" becomes owned by the callback, and it (or some code in the app) needs to eventually call OICFree on this buffer to free it. But I strongly recommend against this design because it's not going to be well-observed by app developers.

resource/csdk/security/provisioning/include/ocprovisioningmanager.h
Line 702: Ok, here you've got the documentation. I still think you should not transfer ownership of the memory to the callback; my preferred way would be to make sure the callback knows it has to copy the contents out to somewhere it controls if it wants to retain a copy of the data, and let it worry about memory management. This method is likely to lead to memory leaks.

But if you really think this is the best way to do it, then explicitly mention OICFree as the function that should be used by the application to free the memory.

Feel free to email me if you need my opinion or help with testing on Windows, etc.
Line 12: Please include Dave Thaler in the code review, when you are ready, because he rejected this kind of workaround last time we discussed it.
Line 15: 1. In this case. the code using the SRM constant lives inside the app's EXE module.

2. The SRM constant lives inside OCTBSTACK.DLL module (not in the EXE).

3. The design of these two modules using each-other's data directly is highly unusual and not recommended, at least in the Windows world. I believe it should be against guidelines for Public IoTivity APIs too. 

If we wanted to ignore this design problem, we'd have to find a way to make the unusual octbstack.dll data exports (e.g., OIC_RSRC_DOXM_URI from octbstack_product_with_tcp.def) work - but we'd rather improve the API design instead.

One theoretical way to improve the design for OIC_RSRC_DOXM_URI would be to add a new octbstack.dll API similar to:

const char* OCGetDoxmURI()
{
    return OIC_RSRC_DOXM_URI;
}

and call that new API instead of using OIC_RSRC_DOXM_URI directly.

But, I don't think it's worth adding all of these new APIs. The size of OIC_RSRC_DOXM_URI is small enough, and the value is publicly documented, so the app can have its own copy of that string. To be consistent with other standard URIs, I think the SRM ones should move into octypes.h, similar to:

/** Device URI.*/
#define OC_RSRVD_DEVICE_URI                   ""/oic/d""

/** Platform URI.*/
#define OC_RSRVD_PLATFORM_URI                 ""/oic/p""

WS adapter is primarily meant for communication between device and cloud services. Thus we don't want to target full security infra from secure onboarding to controlling messages.
In fact we didn't wanted add openssl along with mbedTLS, but libwebsockets library not having support for mbedTLS forced us to inlucde openssl only for WS adapter. By the way there is some work in progress in libwebsockets to include support for mbedTLS and we have plans to change to mbedTLS once its officially released.","A"

If both WITH_TCP and WITH_WS are defined, then both if block and else if block will be included in the code. These conditional blocks will determine the transport based on the endpoint. For websocket PDU, transport will be set to COAP_WS by the else if block.

yes , when there is final update with mbedTLS in libwebsockets, openssl can be removed. Current implementation is well enough to be merged and proceed for next steps. IMO libwebsockets has many features which we can not ignore because of openssl alone. @Harish, create a JIRA about removal openssl when libwebsocket is updated in JIRA and update it here.","A"

Can anyone on this review help me figure out why this does not work when using option 1 (default).

option 1 is the non-secure resource and notify list of observers.
vs.
option 3 secure resource and notify list of observers

I spend a good chunk of time trying to figure out how to get the sample to work with a non-secure resource but I was unable to figure out how.

The reason I am trying to get it to work with a non-secure resource is because that is currently how the Java samples are written.","B"

Phil, This works for the simpleserver 3 option.

3 - secure resource and notify all observers

this does not work for option 1 the non-secure resource an notify all observers.  What I am unsure about is why this does not work for the non-secure. You have specified the same acl for ""auth-crypt"" and ""anon-clear"".  Shouldn't this work for both?

Also your permission is 2 which is Read if I remember right. Which means you do not have permission to notify. If we want notify as well wouldn't the permission need to be 18 (N--R-)?  I am far from being the expert on the security I am still trying go grasp everything so I may be wrong.","A"

To make the non-secure (option 1) work, we need to include the OC_NONSECURE flag while registering the resource, otherwise coaps:// endpoint will be created.

And, a connection type ACE ""anon-clear"" needed for this resource as well. BTW, the ace#4 was created for the non-device owner (31393139-3139-3139-3139-313931393139), we may remove it and the associated credential to avoid confusion. IMHO","A"

Hi George,

Could you verify whether you have the ""anon-clear"" ACE set in the final SVR DB file? I tried a fresh Patch Set 7 and added OC_NONSECURE flags manually, and regenerate the DB file, then the simpleclient can connect to the simpleserver with option 1 and 2.

Another option for progressing is to have the build install gcovr instead of depending on distro version - we already have that need with scons.   I see:

    $ pip search gcovr
    gcovr (3.3)  - A Python script for summarizing gcov data.","B"
